// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Write "please enter 5 numbers" 
Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5 

Write "The average is"
	Set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 
		Write avg 
If(n1 < n2) 
	Set max to n2 
Else
	 Set max to n1 
If(n3 > max) 
	Set max to n3 
If(n4 > max) 
	Set max to n4 
If(n5 > max) 
Set max to n5 
Write "The max is" 
Write max 

If(n1 > n2) 
	Set min to n2 
Else 
	Set min to n1 
If(n3 < min) 
	Set min to n3 
If(n4 < min) 
	Set min to n4 
If(n5 < min) 
	Set min to n5 
Write "The min is" 
Write min
